# ReactJS Boilerplate

## Introduction
A while ago, I started my journey to become a **ReactJS developer**. I learned and became ready to start practising by building ReactJS Apps on my own. As I was building my own projects and some with friends, I started getting annoyed by the default boilerplate that ReactJS gives you, so I had an idea to create my own **ReactJS Boilerplate** based on the things that I usually work with to minimise my suffering.

I created it, and it was nice for a while. Then I stopped working on my projects because I got hired to work at Software Development Company. Long story short, I stopped working with ReactJS because where I work we use NuxtJS, which is like NextJS but with VueJS instead of ReactJS.

So I decided to return to the world of ReactJS, and to begin, I decided to recreate my ReactJS boilerplate based on the projects I worked on at my company and the experience I gained.

## Contribution & Use
Initially, this project was meant for personal use only, but later I realised that other devz might benefit from it or even help me improve the boilerplate. So, feel free to add, refactor, or modify anything you think is useful or that a ReactJS Boilerplate should have, from a small typo to something major, and even a suggestion is welcome.

Like I said earlier, this project was meant for personal use only. If you find this boilerplate useful, you are free to clone and modify it as you see fit for your project, but like I said, this boilerplate is based on the projects I am used to working on.

## Packages
Here I will show all the packages I installed and configured. For some of them, I did some basic configurations, and for others, I wrote some example code just to help you with your own project. And I will leave the documentation link or YouTube video where you can read or watch about a library if you do not know what it does or how to use it.
